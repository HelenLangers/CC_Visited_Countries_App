            <p>Thanks for vising this World Travel Check List app.</p>
            <p>This little project started out as a homework assignment during my time at the CodeClan professional software development bootcamp. I was struggling with my understanding of React and so I kept building upon this fun little project over subsequent weekends and I'm quite proud of where it's turned out.</p>
            <p>Thanks to: <a href="https://restcountries.com/">REST Countries API</a>, <a href="https://react-leaflet.js.org/">Leaflet Mapping</a>, <a href="https://www.react-simple-maps.io/">React Simple Maps</a>
